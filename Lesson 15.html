John went to school with his friends but he and his friends noticed something “Were early!” John said “Yeah” said his friends “Let’s go and play while we wait” said Peter “That’s a good idea” David said “Err… I don’t know, Ruffy doesn’t want to play right now, he is sick, and if we play he’ll want to play to, but if he can’t play with us then he’ll get sad, or he is going to get hurt, or even worse” said John “Ok” said Peter and David “also, do you see a playground anywhere?” John said all that was there was just a street and a side walk and a side walk market “The nearest playground was 20 minutes away and right now is 9:30AM and we’ve gotta get there at 9:55 AM and if we go then we’ll be late” John said

So we just went to school and when we got there we noticed it was Friday!!!! Friday is a game playing day but its homework kind of (Except Minecraft (Because you can do whatever you want (but you have to build you can make a big block message like YOU ARE A DUM HEAD)) so we usually play Minecraft so today we did Minecraft (Like we always do proablelly you guessed it) it was fun, we did a building competition and after that we make a death swap and then we stopped because we had to eat lunch we ate tacos and spaghetti (we only get this on Fridays, but we still get yummy food)
